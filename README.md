# Terraform AWS Demo Architecture

This repo creates all the required resource to run a secure demo application in the AWS cloud to show a specific use case for a test to get a job.

```sh
terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform init && terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

I'm looking for a good job with a competitive salary. I talk to many tech recruiters all the time but am still looking for the right team to work with. Yes I say a number for how much I want salary but really I want a number similar to others on the team and one no one else can give me, if possible.
